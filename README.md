# auto-LED-basic

A system that determines the light in a room to turn on or off lights. 

- 1 Arduino Nano
- 4 male to female jumper wires
- 2 resistance 1kâ„¦
- 1 LED
- 1 light sensor
- 1 Circuit board

# Computer setup

- Dowload Arduino IDE on [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

#The code

- The light sensor will continuously detect the light in the room.
 - If the room is dark, LED will be on
 - If the room is bright, LED will be off.

# Future development direction
